# LLM Reference

This page has been merged into the [Language Reference](reference.md), which includes both human-readable tables and an LLM-optimized quick reference section.

See the [Reference](reference.md) for:
- Complete type system

- TASM instruction mappings and costs
- CLI commands
- Standard library modules
- EBNF grammar
- LLM-optimized compact format
