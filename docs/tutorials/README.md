## The Builder's Journey

Six chapters that build one complete private application,
from a four-line proof to a sovereign DAO.

| # | Document | You Build |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | [Prove a Secret](hello-proof.md) | A hash-locked proof — the primitive behind everything else |
| 2 | [Build a Coin](build-a-coin.md) | A private token with pay, mint, and burn |
| 3 | [Build a Name Service](build-a-name.md) | An ENS-like registry of unique assets |
| 4 | [Build a Liquidity Strategy](build-a-strategy.md) | A constant-product AMM for TIDE |
| 5 | [Auction Names with Hidden Bids](build-an-auction.md) | A Vickrey auction — sealed bids, honest pricing |
| 6 | [Upgrade to a DAO](build-a-dao.md) | Private coin-weighted voting that governs the name service |
