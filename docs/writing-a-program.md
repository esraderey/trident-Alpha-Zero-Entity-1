This page has been merged into the [Tutorial](tutorial.md), which covers the complete first stage of the Trident program lifecycle.

**Writing** > [Compiling](compiling-a-program.md) > [Running](running-a-program.md) > [Deploying](deploying-a-program.md) > [Generating Proofs](generating-proofs.md) > [Verifying Proofs](verifying-proofs.md)

See the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) for:
- Program structure and file layout
- Types, structs, and arrays
- Variables, constants, and operators
- Control flow (if/else, bounded loops, match, return)
- Functions and size generics
- Modules and imports
- I/O and secret input
- Hashing and Merkle proofs
- Events (emit/seal)
- Testing and cost analysis
- Inline assembly
- Key differences from conventional languages
