Trident is a provable programming language.

Every variable, every operation, every function compiles to arithmetic
over the Goldilocks prime field (p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1). Programs produce
STARK proofs — hash-based, post-quantum secure, no trusted setup.

Don't trust. Don't fear. Don't beg.

## Hello, Proof

```trident
program hello_proof

fn main() {
    let a: Field = secret_read()
    let b: Field = secret_read()
    pub_write(a + b)
}
```

```
$ trident build hello.tri
$ trident prove hello --secret 7 --secret 13
  Proof generated (924 cycles, 11 KB)
$ trident verify hello
  Valid: output = 20, inputs hidden
```

A cryptographic proof that `a + b = 20` without revealing `a` or `b`.
Quantum-safe. Zero-knowledge. No trusted setup. No elliptic curves.

## The Mental Model

```
.tri source
  |
  |  trident build
  v
Target assembly (TASM)  +  static cost report
  |
  |  target VM executes
  v
Execution trace
  |
  |  target VM proves
  v
STARK proof + claim
  |
  |  target VM verifies
  v
true / false
```

Trident owns **source -> assembly + cost**. The backend owns
**execute -> trace -> prove -> verify**. The compiler exists to expose
cost, not hide it.

```
$ trident build coin.tri --cost
  Total: 14,832 cycles
  Hash:   8,440 (57%)
  Field:  4,192 (28%)
  Stack:  2,200 (15%)
```

You know the proving bill before you run.

## Neptune

[Neptune Cash](https://neptune.cash/) is where Trident programs run.
It is the only blockchain with recursive STARK proofs in production —
a proof verifies another proof inside itself, so any chain of
transactions collapses into a single cryptographic check. No other
chain does this today.

Neptune is programmable, private, mineable, and quantum-safe. Trident
is its native language, targeting [Triton VM](https://triton-vm.org/).

The following programs are proposed standards — specifications written
in Trident, compiling to TASM today, under validation before deployment:

| Program | What it proposes |
|---------|-----------------|
| [Coin](os/neptune/standards/coin.tri) | Fungible token (TSP-1) — pay, lock, mint, burn, composable hooks |
| [Card](os/neptune/standards/card.tri) | Non-fungible token (TSP-2) — royalties, creator immutability |
| [Lock scripts](os/neptune/locks/) | Multisig, timelock, symmetric spending authorization |
| [Type scripts](os/neptune/types/) | Token conservation laws verified in every transaction |
| [Programs](os/neptune/programs/) | Recursive verification, proof aggregation, relay |

These compile and pass tests. They are not yet deployed. The
interesting thing is not the tokens — it's that every transaction on
Neptune already carries a recursive proof, and these programs extend
what those proofs can express.

See the [Gold Standard](docs/explanation/gold-standard.md) for the full
PLUMB specification.

## Why a New Language

Provable VMs are not conventional CPUs. Treating them as such leaves
orders of magnitude on the table.

**The machine word is a field element, not a byte.** Trident's
primitives — `Field`, `Digest`, `XField` — map directly to what the
VM computes. Rust compiled to RISC-V wraps field operations in
byte-level emulation.

The gap is not marginal:

| Operation | Trident on Triton VM | Rust on SP1 | Rust on RISC Zero |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| One hash (Tip5 / SHA-256) | 1 cycle | ~3,000 cycles | ~1,000 cycles |
| Merkle proof (depth 32) | ~100 cycles | ~96,000 cycles | ~32,000 cycles |

For hash-heavy programs — Merkle trees, content addressing, token
transfers — this is decisive. See
[Comparative Analysis](docs/explanation/provable-computing.md).

**Bounded execution is not a limitation.** It is what makes programs
provable, costs predictable, and (eventually) circuits compilable to
quantum hardware. All loops have explicit bounds. No recursion.
No heap. No halting problem.

**Proofs compose, calls don't.** A proof can verify another proof
inside it. Any chain of proofs collapses into one. Trident is designed
for recursive proof composition — not invocation.

## The Rosetta Stone

Three computational revolutions — quantum, privacy, AI — share a
common algebraic root: the prime field.

A single lookup table over Goldilocks simultaneously functions as:

| Reading | Role | What it provides |
|---------|------|------------------|
| Cryptographic S-box | Hash nonlinearity | Security |
| Neural activation | Network expressiveness | Intelligence |
| FHE bootstrap | Encrypted evaluation | Privacy |
| STARK lookup | Proof authentication | Verifiability |

One table. One field. Four purposes. When all systems operate over the
same prime field, four separate mechanisms collapse into one data
structure read four ways.

[Trinity](docs/explanation/trinity-bench.md) demonstrates this: a single
Trident program encrypts input with LWE, runs a neural layer, hashes
with Tip5, performs FHE bootstrapping, and commits via a quantum
circuit — all inside one STARK trace.

To our knowledge, no existing system composes FHE, neural inference,
hashing, and quantum circuits in a single proof.

## Formal Verification

Annotate. Then prove.

```trident
#[requires(amount > 0)]
#[requires(sender_balance >= amount)]
#[ensures(result == sender_balance - amount)]
fn transfer(sender_balance: Field, amount: Field) -> Field {
    assert(amount > 0)
    assert(sender_balance >= amount)
    sender_balance - amount
}
```

```
$ trident audit transfer.tri
  All 3 properties verified (0.2s)
  No counterexample exists for any input in Field
```

Trident's restrictions — bounded loops, no recursion, finite field
arithmetic — make verification decidable. The compiler proves
correctness automatically. No manual proof construction.
See [Formal Verification](docs/explanation/formal-verification.md).

---

## Content-Addressed Code

Every function has a unique cryptographic identity derived from its
normalized AST. Names are metadata. The hash is the truth.

```
$ trident deploy transfer.tri
  Hash:     #a7f3b2c1d4e8
  Verified: (audit certificate attached)
  Cost:     47 cycles
  Published to registry
```

Rename a function — the hash doesn't change. Publish independently
from the other side of the planet — same code, same hash. Verification
certificates travel with the identity, not the name.
See [Content-Addressed Code](docs/explanation/content-addressing.md).

## Trusting, Not Trust

You download a compiler binary. Someone compiled it — you trust them.
They used a compiler too — you trust that one as well. The trust chain
stretches back to the first hand-assembled binary, and every link is
opaque. Ken Thompson showed in 1984 that a compiler can inject
backdoors invisible in the source.

Trident breaks the chain. The compiler self-hosts: Trident source
compiles Trident source, and the execution produces a STARK proof that
compilation was faithful. Not "we audited the binary." Not "we
reproduced the build." A cryptographic proof, from the mathematics
itself, that the output corresponds to the input.

Three producers compete on the same scoreboard:

```
$ trident bench baselines/triton/std/compiler

Module                       Tri   Hand Neural   Ratio
-------------------------------------------------------
std::compiler::lexer         288      8      -  36.00x
std::compiler::parser        358      8      -  44.75x
std::compiler::pipeline        0      1      -   0.00x
```

`Tri` — compiler output. `Hand` — expert-written assembly (the floor).
`Neural` — a [13M-parameter GNN+Transformer](reference/neural.md)
learning to emit better assembly than the compiler. The dashes mean the
model is training. When it beats the compiler, the number appears.

`src/` is the Rust bootstrap — it shrinks.
`std/compiler/` is the Trident replacement — it grows.

## Quick Start

```
cargo build --release
trident build main.tri           # compile to TASM
trident check main.tri           # type-check only
trident test main.tri            # run #[test] functions
trident fmt main.tri             # format source
trident audit main.tri           # formal verification
trident bench main.tri           # instruction count + cost
```

## Design Principles

1. **Field elements all the way down.** The machine word is `Field`, not `u64`.
2. **Bounded execution.** Explicit loop bounds. No recursion. No halting problem.
3. **Compile-time everything.** Types, array sizes, and costs known statically.
4. **Constraints are features.** No heap, no dynamic dispatch — safety guarantees.
5. **Provable first.** Designed for ZK. These constraints make great conventional programs too.
6. **Minimal dependencies.** 5 runtime crates: clap, ariadne, blake3, tower-lsp, tokio.
